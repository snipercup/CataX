## 1. Introduction/Overview
Pointer3.png is referenced as the custom mouse cursor image in `project.godot`. During headless import, Godot cannot find the imported texture `.godot/imported/pointer3.png-daf3916ed3afea06b8c4267b5a72e06f.ctex`, leading to errors. The goal of this feature is to analyze the usage of `pointer3.png` and decide whether to remove it or restore the missing asset so that import completes without errors.

## 2. Goals
- Determine the role and necessity of `pointer3.png` in the game.
- Ensure `godot --headless --import` runs with no missing file errors.
- If `pointer3.png` is unnecessary, remove references and delete the file.

## 3. User Stories
- *As a developer*, I want to know where `pointer3.png` is referenced so I can assess its importance.
- *As a developer*, I want the import process to run cleanly without missing resource errors.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The system must identify every reference to `pointer3.png` (currently found in `project.godot`).
2. The project must either include a valid imported asset for `pointer3.png` or remove all references to it.
3. Running `godot --headless --import` must complete without failing to load `pointer3.png`.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Implementing fallback pointer logic is not required.
- No other asset issues will be addressed in this feature.

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)
- If removing the pointer, update `project.godot` to use `pointer2.png` or the default cursor so that gameplay remains unaffected.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)
- Deleting `pointer3.png` requires also deleting `Textures/pointer3.png.import` and removing the line in `project.godot` referencing it.
- The missing `.godot/imported` texture may be recreated by opening the project in Godot and reimporting assets.

## 8. Success Metrics
- `godot --headless --import` runs with zero missing resource errors.

## 9. Open Questions
- Should the project maintain a custom cursor image, or is reverting to the default acceptable?
