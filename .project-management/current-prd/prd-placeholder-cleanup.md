## 1. Introduction/Overview
This feature focuses on cleaning the codebase by removing placeholder comments and stub functions. It targets scripts under `Scenes/ContentManager/Mapeditor/Scripts` and `Scripts`. These placeholders confuse developers and add noise to the repository. The goal is to eliminate them so that the codebase reflects only meaningful logic.

## 2. Goals
- Remove all comments referencing "Replace with function body".
- Delete or clean stub methods that contain only placeholder logic.
- Ensure the project builds and existing unit tests pass after cleanup.

## 3. User Stories
- **As a developer**, I want to read scripts without placeholder comments so that the intent of each function is clear.
- **As a developer**, I want unused stub methods removed to reduce clutter when navigating the code.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. Identify all occurrences of the text "Replace with function body" in `Scenes/ContentManager/Mapeditor/Scripts` and `Scripts`.
2. For each occurrence:
   - If the method body only contains a `pass` statement, delete the entire function.
   - If the method contains other logic, remove only the placeholder comment.
3. Confirm the cleanup for at least:
   - `Map_Editor_Areas_Popup.gd`
   - `weapon.gd`
   - `test_environment.gd`
   - Any additional scripts containing the placeholder text.
4. Run the default GUT tests to validate the project after modifications.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Implementing new functionality or gameplay changes.
- Modifying the map editor interface or its scene files.
- Changing behavior beyond removing placeholder code.

## 6. Design Considerations
- None. No UI updates are planned.

## 7. Technical Considerations
- Follow Godot 4.4 and GDScript 4 style conventions (tabs for indentation, `class_name` usage where needed).
- Ensure no broken signal connections or references remain after removing functions.

## 8. Success Metrics
- All placeholder comments are gone from the specified directories.
- Stub methods containing only placeholders are removed without introducing runtime errors.
- `godot --headless` unit tests pass.

## 9. Open Questions
- Are there additional scripts outside the specified folders that contain similar placeholders?

## 10. Referenced PRD-background files
