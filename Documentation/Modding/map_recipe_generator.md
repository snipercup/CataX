# Recipe-driven map generator

`Tools/map_generator.py` converts a compact JSON recipe into a complete Dimensionfall map JSON file. Dimensionfall maps have fixed dimensions of 32 x 32 tiles. The generator creates one populated ground level (level array index `10`) with exactly 1024 entries and leaves the other 20 levels empty.

## Usage

Run from the repository root:

```sh
python3 Tools/map_generator.py \
  Tools/examples/map_recipe.json \
  /tmp/generated_meadow_prototype.json
python3 Tools/map_validator.py /tmp/generated_meadow_prototype.json
```

The output filename must be `<id>.json`, matching the map loader's filename-derived ID. Existing output is protected. Pass `--overwrite` only when replacement is intended. Use `--tiles PATH` to validate tile IDs against a tile database other than `Mods/Dimensionfall/Tiles/Tiles.json`.

For batch generation of deterministic seed variants and instructions for inspecting them in Godot's content editor, see [`map_example_generation.md`](map_example_generation.md).

## Recipe format

The root must be a JSON object with these fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Map ID using only letters, numbers, `_`, and `-`. |
| `name` | non-empty string | Display name. |
| `description` | non-empty string | Map description. |
| `seed` | integer | Fixed seed used by palettes, random tile rotations, scatter, and pattern cells. Recipe input only; the map format does not store it. |
| `base_tile` | tile object | Tile initially placed in every cell. |
| `palette` | object | Named weighted tile sets that tile objects can reference. Optional; defaults to `{}`. |
| `patterns` | object | Named arrays of relative tile placements used by `pattern` operations. Optional; defaults to `{}`. |
| `regions` | array | Legacy filled rectangles. Optional; defaults to `[]`. |
| `operations` | array | Ordered placement operations. Optional; defaults to `[]`. |

A recipe does not define map dimensions: all generated maps are 32 x 32. Coordinates start at the top-left. Every shape must fit entirely within the map; operations are never silently clipped.

A tile object has exactly one of:

- `id`: a raw tile ID from the selected `Tiles.json`; or
- `palette`: the name of a root-level palette.

It may also include an optional `rotation` when using `id`. Rotation is `0`, `90`, `180`, `270`, or `"random"`. Operation tiles may be `null`, which writes the project's empty-tile representation, `{}`.

Palette entries are objects with `id`, optional positive integer `weight` (default `1`), and optional `rotation`. Palette names may contain only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. Palette selection uses the same seeded random-number generator as scatter and random rotation, so the same complete recipe and seed produce identical output. Changing a recipe from a raw tile to a palette reference may change later random choices because palette selection consumes random numbers.

```json
{
  "palette": {
    "ground": [
      {"id": "grass_plain_01", "weight": 8, "rotation": "random"},
      {"id": "grass_flowers_00", "weight": 2, "rotation": "random"}
    ],
    "path": [
      {"id": "dirt_light_00", "weight": 3},
      {"id": "grass_dirt_00", "weight": 1, "rotation": "random"}
    ]
  },
  "base_tile": {"palette": "ground"}
}
```

Legacy `regions` are applied first in array order, followed by `operations` in array order. Pattern cells are expanded in their definition order at the position of the invoking operation. Later placements overwrite earlier cells, including repeated offsets inside one pattern. `regions` remain supported for version-one recipes and use the same filled-rectangle placement implementation as `rectangle` operations.

## Reusable cell patterns

`patterns` maps a name to a non-empty array of relative tile placements. Pattern names follow the same naming rules as palettes. Every cell has an integer `[x, y]` offset in `at` and a `tile`; offsets may be negative, and tiles may use raw IDs, palettes, rotations, or `null` just like operation tiles.

Pattern definitions do not consume random numbers. An invoked pattern consumes randomness in cell-array order only when a cell uses a palette or `"random"` tile rotation. Unused definitions therefore do not change generated output.

```json
{
  "patterns": {
    "wildflower_cluster": [
      {"at": [0, 0], "tile": {"palette": "flowers"}},
      {"at": [1, 0], "tile": {"palette": "flowers"}},
      {"at": [-1, 1], "tile": {"palette": "flowers"}}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Placement operations

Every operation requires a `type`. Unknown operation types and fields are errors.

### `set`

Places one tile. Fields: `type`, `x`, `y`, and `tile`.

```json
{"type": "set", "x": 16, "y": 15, "tile": {"id": "grass_flowers_01"}}
```

### `rectangle`

Fills a rectangle. Fields: `type`, `x`, `y`, positive `width`, positive `height`, and `tile`.

```json
{"type": "rectangle", "x": 10, "y": 9, "width": 12, "height": 14, "tile": {"id": "grass_plain_01"}}
```

### `rectangle_outline`

Places only the rectangle border and uses the same fields as `rectangle`. If width or height is `1`, every cell in the resulting one-cell-wide shape is border.

```json
{"type": "rectangle_outline", "x": 10, "y": 9, "width": 12, "height": 14, "tile": {"id": "grass_dirt_00"}}
```

### `line`

Places an inclusive, one-tile-wide line between integer `[x, y]` endpoints. Fields: `type`, `from`, `to`, and `tile`. Lines use the integer Bresenham algorithm, so horizontal, vertical, diagonal, steep, and reversed lines are deterministic.

```json
{"type": "line", "from": [0, 16], "to": [31, 16], "tile": {"id": "dirt_light_00"}}
```

### `scatter`

Selects unique cells in a rectangular `region` using the recipe's seeded random-number generator. Fields: `type`, `region`, exactly one of `count` or `density`, and `tile`.

- `count` is an integer from zero through the number of cells in the region.
- `density` is a number from `0` through `1`; the placement count is `floor(region area × density)`.
- Selected cells replace their existing tiles.
- The same complete recipe and seed produce the same selection and output.

```json
{
  "type": "scatter",
  "region": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 32, "height": 32},
  "density": 0.1,
  "tile": {"id": "grass_flowers_00", "rotation": "random"}
}
```

### `pattern`

Places every cell from a named pattern relative to an anchor. Fields: `type`, `pattern`, `at`, and optional `rotation`. Rotation defaults to `0` and accepts fixed clockwise quarter turns: `0`, `90`, `180`, or `270`.

Offsets rotate around the anchor: `90` maps `[x, y]` to `[-y, x]`. The generator preflights the complete expansion and rejects the operation if any resulting cell is outside the map; patterns are never clipped or partially applied.

```json
{
  "type": "pattern",
  "pattern": "wildflower_cluster",
  "at": [16, 12],
  "rotation": 90
}
```

## Validation and limitations

The generator rejects unknown fields at every recipe level, root-level dimension fields, malformed or out-of-bounds placements, malformed tile databases, unknown tile IDs, invalid rotations, invalid Unicode, and non-object recipes. It validates generated data with `Tools/map_validator.py` before publishing the output.

The output uses 21 levels, with the generated row-major grid at index 10. It sets `categories` to `[]`, `weight` to `1000`, and all four connections to `"ground"`. It omits `areas`, matching `DMap.get_data()` when the area list is empty.

The generator does not yet create features, furniture, areas, roads as semantic objects, buildings, towns, additional levels, nested patterns, or shape-based templates. Structural validity also does not yet guarantee walkability or gameplay quality.
