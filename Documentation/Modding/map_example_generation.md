# Manual example-map generation

`Tools/generate_map_examples.py` generates deterministic variants of maintained map recipes for manual inspection. It delegates map construction, validation, overwrite protection, and atomic publication to `Tools/map_generator.py`; it does not contain a second generator implementation.

Run all commands from the repository root. On the standard Hermes host checkout:

```bash
cd ~/local/dimensionfall/repository
```

## Generate one maintained recipe directly into the mod

Use `Tools/map_generator.py` when you want to select one recipe, preserve its map ID, and publish exactly one map directly into the Dimensionfall mod:

```bash
python3 Tools/map_generator.py \
  Tools/examples/map_recipe_two_level_hill.json \
  Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_two_level_hill.json
```

The maintained recipe examples are:

| Recipe | Output map | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Tools/examples/map_recipe.json` | `Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_meadow_prototype.json` | Ground-level palettes, placement operations, scatter, and reusable patterns. |
| `Tools/examples/map_recipe_two_level_hill.json` | `Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_two_level_hill.json` | Ground level `z: 0`, raised terrain at `z: 1`, and all four slope rotations. |
| `Tools/examples/map_recipe_two_level_depression.json` | `Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_two_level_depression.json` | Ground level `z: 0`, lowered terrain at `z: -1`, and all four slope rotations. |

For both multi-level examples, slope rotations use the map editor convention: `0` has its high edge north, `90` east, `180` south, and `270` west. The generator writes those values directly; Godot performs the slope-specific runtime conversion when loading a newly generated map.

When manually testing either multi-level example, check every slope from both directions:

1. approach from the lower-level side;
2. walk up the visible slope and onto the high-side tile;
3. turn around and walk back down;
4. confirm there is no invisible wall or collision plane with a different orientation;
5. repeat for north, east, south, and west high edges.

Automated GUT coverage verifies that conversion, rendering vertices, collision geometry, and navigation-source faces agree on each high edge. Manual testing is still required to confirm the asynchronously baked navigation mesh and player controller traverse the complete transition correctly.

Copy the corresponding command for the map you want to inspect:

```bash
# Ground-level meadow
python3 Tools/map_generator.py \
  Tools/examples/map_recipe.json \
  Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_meadow_prototype.json

# Two-level hill
python3 Tools/map_generator.py \
  Tools/examples/map_recipe_two_level_hill.json \
  Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_two_level_hill.json

# Two-level depression
python3 Tools/map_generator.py \
  Tools/examples/map_recipe_two_level_depression.json \
  Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_two_level_depression.json
```

The output filename should match the recipe's `id`, followed by `.json`. The generator validates the map before publishing it and refuses to replace an existing file. To deliberately regenerate the same map after editing its recipe, add `--overwrite`:

```bash
python3 Tools/map_generator.py \
  Tools/examples/map_recipe_two_level_hill.json \
  Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_two_level_hill.json \
  --overwrite
```

After generating a map, start or restart Godot and follow the content-editor steps below. Files created directly with `map_generator.py` are not registered in the example runner's cleanup manifest. Remove them explicitly when manual testing is complete:

```bash
rm Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_meadow_prototype.json
rm Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_two_level_hill.json
rm Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_two_level_depression.json
```

Only run the removal command for a file you actually generated. These maintained IDs are intended for development examples; do not overwrite a map with the same ID if it has been repurposed as project content.

## Safe first run

Generate three variants in a temporary directory:

```bash
python3 Tools/generate_map_examples.py \
  --output-dir /tmp/dimensionfall-map-examples
```

The default recipe is `Tools/examples/map_recipe.json`. Each variant receives:

- a unique ID and matching filename ending in `_example_001`, `_example_002`, and so on;
- a sequential seed, beginning with the recipe's seed unless `--seed` is supplied;
- complete 32 x 32 map data validated before publication.

Inspect the generated files with the validator if desired:

```bash
python3 Tools/map_validator.py /tmp/dimensionfall-map-examples
```

## Choose the number of variants and starting seed

Generate five reproducible variants using seeds `1000` through `1004`:

```bash
python3 Tools/generate_map_examples.py \
  --output-dir /tmp/dimensionfall-map-examples \
  --variants 5 \
  --seed 1000
```

Running the same complete recipe with the same starting seed produces the same map JSON. Changing the seed changes seeded scatter placement and random tile rotations.

## Inspect generated maps in the content editor

Place examples in the core mod's map directory:

```bash
python3 Tools/generate_map_examples.py \
  --output-dir Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps \
  --variants 3 \
  --seed 1000
```

Launch Godot after generation and run the Dimensionfall project.
In the running project, navigate to:

```text
Content Manager
  → Content Editor
  → select the Dimensionfall mod
  → Expand the Maps category if it is still collapsed
  → open a generated map by doubleclicking it in the map list
  → View Map in the editor, click `save and test` to test it manually
```

If Godot was already running when files were generated, restart it so mod content is loaded again. The existing map-editor preview displays generated map JSON; the Python tool does not create a separate image or HTML preview.

Dimensionfall also looks for a same-named `.png` map sprite during startup. The runner intentionally generates map JSON only, so Godot currently logs a non-fatal missing-resource error for that sprite. This does not prevent the JSON map from loading or the map editor's tile-grid preview from rendering it.

## Generate from specific recipes

Pass one or more recipe paths before the options. The runner generates the requested number of variants for every recipe:

```bash
python3 Tools/generate_map_examples.py \
  Tools/examples/map_recipe.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/dimensionfall-map-examples \
  --variants 2 \
  --seed 500
```

For example, generate one cleanup-managed hill and one cleanup-managed depression directly in the mod folder:

```bash
python3 Tools/generate_map_examples.py \
  Tools/examples/map_recipe_two_level_hill.json \
  Tools/examples/map_recipe_two_level_depression.json \
  --output-dir Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps \
  --variants 1
```

This produces:

```text
Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_two_level_hill_example_001.json
Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps/generated_two_level_depression_example_001.json
```

Use `map_generator.py` for one exact recipe output. Use `generate_map_examples.py` when you want multiple seeds, multiple recipes in one command, or manifest-based cleanup.

Use a different tile database when testing another mod's recipe:

```bash
python3 Tools/generate_map_examples.py \
  path/to/recipe.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/dimensionfall-map-examples \
  --tiles path/to/Tiles.json
```

## Overwrite protection

Existing output files are protected by default. A repeated command using the same IDs reports an error instead of replacing them.

To deliberately regenerate those files, add `--overwrite`:

```bash
python3 Tools/generate_map_examples.py \
  --output-dir /tmp/dimensionfall-map-examples \
  --variants 3 \
  --seed 1000 \
  --overwrite
```

An overwritten file that was not originally created by this runner is not claimed by its cleanup manifest and will not be deleted by `--clean`.

## Safe cleanup

The runner records newly created output filenames and SHA-256 digests in:

```text
.dimensionfall-map-examples-manifest
```

The manifest has no `.json` extension, so it is not treated as a map. Cleanup removes only recorded map files whose contents still match their generated SHA-256 digest:

```bash
python3 Tools/generate_map_examples.py \
  --output-dir /tmp/dimensionfall-map-examples \
  --clean
```

Remove examples installed for editor inspection with:

```bash
python3 Tools/generate_map_examples.py \
  --output-dir Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps \
  --clean
```

Unrelated maps in the output directory are left untouched. A generated path that has since been changed or replaced is also preserved. If the manifest is missing, cleanup removes nothing. If it is malformed, cleanup stops rather than guessing which files are safe to delete.

## Useful checks

Show all command options:

```bash
python3 Tools/generate_map_examples.py --help
```

Run the focused Godot slope-geometry regression suite:

```bash
godot --headless --path . \
  -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd \
  -gtest=Tests/Unit/test_chunk_slope_rotation.gd \
  -gexit
```

Validate all generated maps in a temporary output directory:

```bash
python3 Tools/map_validator.py /tmp/dimensionfall-map-examples
```

Confirm generated map dimensions and populated levels:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json
from pathlib import Path

for path in sorted(Path("/tmp/dimensionfall-map-examples").glob("*.json")):
    data = json.loads(path.read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
    populated = [index for index, level in enumerate(data["levels"]) if level]
    print(
        path.name,
        f"{data['mapwidth']}x{data['mapheight']}",
        f"ground entries={len(data['levels'][10])}",
        f"populated levels={populated}",
    )
PY
```

## Current limitations

- Variants change the recipe seed; they do not synthesize new recipe operations.
- Generated maps contain terrain only. Multiple populated logical levels are supported, but furniture, areas, buildings, semantic roads, multi-level templates, and automatic traversal validation are not supported yet.
- The maps can be inspected with the existing content-editor preview, but the runner does not launch Godot or inject maps into an already-running editor session.
- Installing examples under `Mods/Dimensionfall/Maps` makes them available to the content editor, but does not automatically reference them from overmap-area generation.
