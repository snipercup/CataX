## Dimensionfall: World Lore and Setting Overview

### Our dimension (199X)

Dimensionfall takes place in an alternate version of our world, set in the ambiguous year of **199X**. Technology is frozen in a strange state—personal computers like the iconic **Amigo** dominate homes and workplaces, alongside outdated machinery and analog devices. Landlines, pagers, and fax machines form the backbone of communication, while dial-up internet hums through crackling phone lines.

The location is deliberately undefined but draws heavy inspiration from post-Soviet, Eastern European settings. Imagine crumbling concrete buildings, bleak industrial zones, and sprawling forests under gray skies. Rusting railway lines crisscross the land, a fading reminder of a once-connected world. Life here is practical, often harsh, and colored by the remnants of a communist past. This world serves as the foundation—the baseline dimension from which all other realities diverge.

### The Collapse: Dimensional convergence

But something went wrong.

Suddenly, through some cosmic event—or perhaps something far more sinister—reality fractured. At first, the signs were minimal—strange objects appearing where they did not belong, things are out of place. As time progressed, landscapes shifted, and the result is a twisted, unstable reality where entities, artifacts, and environments from countless other dimensions have fused into our dimension.

Survivors call this brief but cataclysmic period the **Fall**.

### Fractured Realities: Influences from other dimensions

The world is now a chaotic patchwork of conflicting technologies, cultures, and horrors. The convergence brought strange new opportunities but also unimaginable dangers. These are some of the most notable dimensions that seeped into the Default:

- **Modern World (201X-20XX)**: Smartphones, the internet, and sleek consumer tech find their way into the hands of scavengers. Devices flicker to life, desperately searching for a connection to a world that no longer exists.

- **Cyberpunk Future**: Augmented mercenaries roam the wastes with bionic limbs and retinal implants. Rogue AI constructs lurk within derelict servers, and corporate enclaves fight to carve out new empires amidst the ruins.

- **Biopunk Nightmare**: Perhaps the most disturbing of all. A dimension where biology replaced silicon. Flesh-bound weapons, living armor, chimeric beasts, and grotesque human experiments roam freely. Mutations are both a curse and a tool for survival.

- \*\*Other \***punk Subgenres**: Dieselpunk war machines rust in abandoned factories, while steampunk automatons sputter with steam in forgotten laboratories. The possibilities are endless.

- **Fantasy Realm**: Knights in corroded plate armor stand beside elves with weary eyes. Ruins whisper of ancient magic, while enchanted weapons clash with off-world technology. Magic exists here—but its laws remain unclear.

- **The Plague Dimension (Zombies, but Twisted)**: The undead shuffle through the streets—but they are not merely mindless husks. The infection evolves, creating fungal horrors, parasitic masses, and undead that remember their past lives.

### The World After

The Fall was not a single event but a sudden, violent collapse. Cities crumbled under the weight of disasters both familiar and alien. Traces of catastrophe linger—twisted wreckage, scorched ruins, and poisoned rivers. Streets buckle and buildings crumble, leaving behind a broken world scarred by disasters both natural and unnatural.

Each region bears scars of these calamities. Survivors pick through the wreckage of plane crashes, the fuselage rusting alongside eldritch ruins from other dimensions. Life persists, but the landscape itself reminds all who endure: the world is broken, and the Fall has left its mark.

Our dimension is now a brutal survival ground. Humanity clings to existence in scattered enclaves, walled settlements, or nomadic bands. Trust is scarce. Relics from other dimensions can offer power—but they can also bring corruption, mutation, or worse.

This is the world of Dimensionfall—a place where dimensions collide; where magic and machine intertwine; and where every day is a battle to endure the chaos left in the wake of the Fall.
